Hi James,

Here is some code I have adjusted for ecmf.

There should be 4 attachments to this email:

1) VECM_comp.m
2) ecmf_comp.m
3) ecmftest.m
4) bvarf_g_new.m

The main example program is VECM_comp.m. This code specifies some
endogenous data and then asks for forecasts up to 8 periods ahead using
ecmf_comp.m - this program returns the bmat generated by ecmf.m and also
the bmat generated from ecm.m - the latter is the same as the estimate
produced by Eviews. Furthermore, on line 147 of ecmf_comp I noticed that
the forecasts call the wrong element of the endogenous data (I think).
See also my code - ecmftest.m where I have used the bmat from ecm.m and
also rewritten the forecasting code (although this will not work for the
case where the researcher only wants 1-step-ahead forecasts, at
present). ecmftest.m produces the same forecasts as Eviews. A quick look
at becmf.m suggests that it suffers from exactly the same problems (both
wrong bmat and wrong element call).

I also spotted a bug in bvarf_g where the original code did not work
with exogneous variables, in my case with a time trend. The problem
arose because either the dimension of the exogenous data is correct for
estimation in bvar_g but too small for forecasting, or correct for
forecasting but too large for estimation. See notes on line 172.

I hope this helps,

Adam

PS. Most, if not all, of my comments are preceded with "ADAM's NOTE:" to
aid easy searching to see what I have adjusted.
