as well as LM and LR tests developed by N. Debarsy and C. Ertur "Testing for 
Spatial Autocorrelation in a Fixed Effects Panel Data Model" 
(LEO Working Paper n°2009-12 - halshs-00414133_v1) that can be downloaded from REPEC.

It is based on previous codes elaborated by J.P. Elhorst and J.P. LeSage.
