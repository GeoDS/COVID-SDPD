function [c,u,l]=bsds(bench,models,B,w,boot)
% Calculate Whites and Hansens p-vals for outperformance using the Reality
% Check (White) and the Test for Superior Predictive Accuracy (Hansen)
%
% USAGE:
%   [C]=bsds(BENCH,MODELS,B,W)
%   [C,U,L]=bsds(BENCH,MODELS,B,W,BOOT)
%
% INPUTS:
%   BENCH  - The return series form the benchmark model
%   MODELS - The return series from each of the models used for comparrison
%   B      - Number of Bootstrap replications
%   W      - Desired block length
%   BOOT   - [OPTIONAL] 'STATIONARY' or 'BLOCK'.  Stationary will be used as default.
%
% OUTPUTS:
%   C - Consistent P-val(Hansen)
%   U - Upper P-val(White) (Original RC P-vals)
%   L - Lower P-val(Hansen)
%
% COMMENTS:
%   This version of the BSDS operates on quatities that should be 'bad',
%   such as losses.  The null hypothesis is that the average performance of 
%   the benchmark is as small as the minimum average performance across the
%   models.  The alternative is that the minimum average loss across
%   the models is smaller than the the average performance of the benchmark.
%
%   If the quantities of interest are 'goods', such as returns, simple call
%   bsds_studentized with -1*BENCH and -1*MODELS
